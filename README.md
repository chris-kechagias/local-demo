# Git Workflow Practice

Hands-on practice with Git workflows, branching strategies, and local-to-remote synchronization.

## What I Practiced

✅ Creating and switching branches  
✅ Making isolated changes on feature branches  
✅ Merging branches back to main  
✅ Resolving merge conflicts  
✅ Local repository management  
✅ Pushing local changes to remote (GitHub)  
✅ SSH authentication workflow

## Branching Strategy Practiced

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"

# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge feature-name

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```
